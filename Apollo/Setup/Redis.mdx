# Redis Bungee Sync
Redis Bungee Sync allows you to sync all your different instances. This allows you to synchronize alerts and some amounts of computed data between servers.<br />
First, locate the redis-alerts section, then set the authentication and connection information for your database. <br />
Then customize the alert message and set enabled to true.

:::warning
To avoid issues, make sure to set the `maxmemory-policy` value of the redis server config to `allkeys-lfu`
:::

:::note
If you do not have your own Redis database then you can create one at [redis.com](https://redis.com/)
