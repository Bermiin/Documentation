# Apollo Realtime Network Sync
Apollo Realtime Network Sync allows you to sync all your different instances via a redis server. This allows you to synchronize alerts and some amounts of computed data between servers, improving performance <br />
First, locate the redis-alerts section, then set the authentication and connection information for your database. <br />
Then customize the alert message and set enabled to true.

:::warning
To avoid issues, make sure to set the `maxmemory-policy` value of the redis server config to `allkeys-lfu`, and to set the `maxmemory` value to a reasonable value like `4000mb` for 4gb.
:::

:::warning
Apollo Realtime Network Sync also requires a normal database to be setup.
:::

:::note
If you do not have your own redis database then you can create one at [redis.com (Recommended)](https://redis.com/) or [Upstash (Not recommended, pay-as-you-go plan is required)](https://upstash.com/)
:::

:::info
[KeyDB](https://docs.keydb.dev/docs/ppa-deb) is a higher performance database that can be used with Apollo Realtime Network Sync.
