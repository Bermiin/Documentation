## Introduction

Apollo Anticheat Remote Data Management Addon is an amazing addon to Apollo that is specially designed to enhance the server operator's experience by providing a wide range of improved operational efficiencies. With the Apollo Anticheat Remote Data Management Addon, you can scale your servers using Apollo more easily, and more efficiently by centralizing the management of data. This addon can also improve the efficiency and accuracy of the false flag detection system.

## Deployment

Once purchased, upload the Addon to a server (and use the included start.sh script to start it), set the port and MySQL connection info in the config.toml file, then restart the addon.

## Anticheat Integration
1. Locate the `false_flags.remote-server` section in `config.conf`.
2. Set `remote-server` to the IP address of the server to connect to. (eg. `127.0.0.1`)
3. Set `remote-port` to the port that you are running the addon on.
4. Set `token` to any of the randomly generated tokens from the config.toml file the addon generated.
5. Set `enabled` to true.
6. Run `/apollo reload` or restart your server for maximum performance.
