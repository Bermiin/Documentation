# Check Groups / Actions / Punishments setup

Further syntax-related documentation, and examples are included in the checkgroups.conf file.

## What are Check Groups?
Check Groups are groups of checks grouped together to make punishment configuration easier.
There are four check groups by default, `Combat`, `Player`, `Movement` and `Default`, however you do not need to use these and can add custom ones.

## What are actions?
Apollo Actions are enhanced commands the anticheat can execute to punish a player, for example, send a discord webhook, run a ban command, add proof to a phoenix ban, or setback a player.

## Database Integration
Apollo **only** logs commands (and custom actions like phoenix ban) that are formatted with `PUNISH %YOURCOMMANDHERE%` to the database.

## What actions exist?
