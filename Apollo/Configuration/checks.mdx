# Check Config
This config file allows you to configure the checks of the anticheat.

## File Layout

The file is first grouped by check categories, then check types, then check ids to allow for easy navigation.

## Check Config Values

### enabled (required)
Is the check enabled?

### group (required)
Which [check group](/Apollo/Configuration/checkgroups) should the check be assigned to?

### buffer-type configuration blocks (only on some checks)
Configure how often the check flags. A buffer allows you to configure a limit of pre-flags before a real flag happens, as well as how fast they increase, the maximum pre-flags and how fast they decrease.

### Other Config Values
Other config values usually relate to internal components of a check, usually have documentation explaining what they do, and sometimes have documentation explaining when to increase or decrease the value.
