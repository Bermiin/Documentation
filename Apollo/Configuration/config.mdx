# Main Config
The main config of Apollo is where you configure the core of Apollo.

## alerts
Configure the alerts from the anticheat.

### console
Do you want alerts to be sent to console?

### message
The message to use as the alert message. 

#### Message Specific Placeholders:
- %dev% (Displays a * if the check is a experimental check)
- %vl% (Displays the amount of flags the check has for the player)
- %check% (The name of the check, ex. Speed)
- %type% (The id of the check, ex. A)

## analysis
Configure the background analysis component of Apollo. This allows you to catch more cheaters, faster. Most options are self explaining, or have good comments and therefore will not be featured here.

### client_analysis
Configure the client analysis system that detects some cheat clients on join.

### drag_click_fix
Enable this if you allow drag clicking or 25+ cps clicking on your server.

## ban_delay
Ban delays allow you to delay bans for 30 seconds to allow staff to cancel or report any false bans before the player gets banned. Alternatively, staff can click the instant ban button to instantly ban the player.
Most options here are self explaining.

### enabled
Enable this to use the ban delay system.

## database
Configure the database here. (More information on common options is here.)[/Apollo/Setup/Database]

### cache_purge_time
How often should we run the automatic recent log expiry system? Lowering this quickly increases cpu usage, increasing this will slowly increase memory usage.

## features
Random extra features are listed in this section.

### apollo-hit-detection
This improves the hit detection by fixing issues with the client, while also tuning some other internals to improve hit detection.

#### spoof-particle
An experimental debug option you should not use, unless you get cases where players health goes down without the attack being acknowledged to the client.

## hider
Hides the anticheat by changing the command.

### enabled
Enable the hider?

### name
The new name for the anticheat.

## hooks
Integrations with other plugins

### carbon
Hooks with the carbon chunks system to improve performance. This has sub-values that you should enable when the matching option in your settings.yml is also enabled.

### phoenix
Integrates with Phoenix core to provide enhanced punishments with proof and more.

#### ban_formats
All the premade ban formats you want to use with PX_BAN/PX_COMP actions.

#### enabled
Enable the integration? Enable this if you use Phoenix Core.

#### proof_format
The format for the proof.

#### silent
Should the anticheat do silent bans or non silent bans?

## messages
Configure the messages here. Most values have comments and are not documented here.

### prefix
The Prefix for the anticheat. Use in combination with the hider feature, mentioned above.

### name
The name for the anticheat. Use in combination with the hider feature, mentioned above.

### `redis-alerts`
(Read more here)[/Apollo/Setup/Sync]

## setbacks
Configure lagbacks, setbacks and ghost block handling here.

### damage_settings
Configure damage given to players when they are lagged back for cheating

### ghost_block_settings
Configure the ghost block lagbacks. Do not disable this unless you want crazy bypasses.

### initial_teleports
Configure the handling of join teleports. Mis-configuring this can cause bypasses, or weirdness.
If you end up with players being incorrectly teleported out of arenas or similar, then consider modifying this.

### resend_teleports
This has a good comment, but in summary, it lets you configure how teleports are resent. It is recommended to set this to TICKS for smooth setbacks, and to PING to not send many extra teleports.

## threads
Configure the threading system of the anticheat.

### max_threads
Configure the maximum number of threads to target.

### players_per_threads
How many players should we try to put on each thread?

### async_pre_tick
Run some pre-processing async? This can reduce main thread load, but may cause some false flags.

## transactions
Configure Apollo's lag handling

### max_delay
The maximum amount of time a player can not respond to packets for before being kicked. Increasing this can quickly cause bypasses, lowering too far can cause false kicks.

### kick
What message do we kick players with if they ignore packets for too long?

### send_extra_packet
Send an extra packet to prevent false flags? It is not recommended to disable this.

### tracker_exempt
Exempt the player while block states are not fully known? Can cause a lot of bypasses.

## vpn_detection
Configure the vpn detection system. This is not a traditional antivpn system as it mainly works in ways other than kicking/banning the player.

### enable
Enable the VPN detection system? This will send ips of your players to the antivpn services configured below.

### ordering
The order of antivpn services to try. Services that are not first are only used if the first one is down.

#### Available Options:
- VPNAPI - Good AntiVPN API that detects most VPNs and proxies. Has fast responses, but requires an API key to be configured below. This is not used by default, if you want to use it, add `VPNAPI` to the top of the list, and set your API key below.
- IPRisk - Good AntiVPN API that detects most VPNs and proxies. Has slow response times. Is also used in Phoenix. View more info (here)[https://iprisk.info/]
- ProVPN - Basic free AntiVPN service.
- Mario - [oddmario](https://github.com/oddmario) Anti Fraud, a basic antivpn service that is down half the time. 

### vpnapi-api-key
If you want to use the [VPNAPI](https://vpnapi.io/) service, then configure your key here, and add `VPNAPI` to the top of your ordering list. You can get a key at [vpnapi.io](https://vpnapi.io/).

### mitigate
Make the anticheat slightly stricter for people who use vpns?

### kick
Kick players who use VPNs? This is not recommended.

### kick-message
The message to kick players with if the `kick` option is enabled.

## webhooks
Configure the discord webhooks. Most of these options are self explaining. 

:::note
You need to use the webhook action in your [Check Groups Config](/Apollo/configuration/checkgroups) to make this send anything.
