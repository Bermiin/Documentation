# False Flag Detection
Apollo False Flag Detection uses machine learning to detect false flags based on data from the alerts, and reported false flags using buttons in ban delays, or on punishments.
Apollo False Flag Detection completely prevents reported false flags from flagging after certain thresholds, configurable in the config.
Apollo False Flag Detection is enhanced a lot by the [Remote Data Management Addon](/Apollo/Addons/AARDMA).
