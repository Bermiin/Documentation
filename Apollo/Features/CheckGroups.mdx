Check Groups are groups of checks grouped together to make punishment configuration easier.
Syntax related documentation, and examples are included in the checkgroups.conf file.

There are four check groups by default, `Combat`, `Player`, `Movement` and `Default`, 
however you do not need to use these and can add custom ones.

## Actions

Apollo Actions are enhanced commands the anticheat can execute to punish a player, for example, send a discord webhook, run a ban command, add proof to a phoenix ban, or setback a player.

## Database

Apollo **only** logs commands (and custom actions like phoenix bans) that are formatted with `PUNISH %YOURCOMMANDHERE%` to the database.
