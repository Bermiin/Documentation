title: Check Configuration
---

The `checks.conf` file allows you to configure the checks and their functionality.

Checks look for specific cheats that a player has, eg: Killaura, Flight, etc. The same cheat can have multiple different checks (Killaura A, Killaura B) and have individual descriptions.

## Values

For easy navigation, the file is grouped in order by:
1. Check Category. (eg. Combat)
2. Check Type. (eg. Killaura)
3. Check ID. (eg. A)

### enabled

- **Required:** `true`
- **Type:** `Boolean`
- **Description:** Is the check enabled?

### group

- **Required:** `true`
- **Type:** `String`
- **Description:** Which check group should the check be assigned to?

### Buffer Type Blocks

Configure how often the check flags. A buffer allows you to configure a limit of pre-flags before a real flag happens, as well as how fast they increase, the maximum pre-flags and how fast they decrease.

### Other Values

Other config values relate to internal components of a check, and usually have documentation explaining what they do and when to increate or decrease the value.
