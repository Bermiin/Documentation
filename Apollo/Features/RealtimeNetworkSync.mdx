title: Realtime Network Sync
---

Apollo Realtime Network Sync allows you to sync Apollo data and alerts between all your different instances via a redis server.

This is useful on bungeecord networks, and can provide general performance improvements, while also preventing certain bugs on networks with multiple server instances running Apollo.

## Setup

1. Locate `redis-alerts` in your `config.conf` file.
2. Set `host` and `port` to point towards your redis server.
3. If required, set `username`/`password` for authentication.
4. Customize `format` and set `enabled` to `true`.

## Redis

Realtime Network Sync requires a [Redis](https://redis.com/) or [KeyDB](https://docs.keydb.dev/docs/ppa-deb) database to be setup (KeyDB is a higher performance database that can be used with Apollo Realtime Network Sync)

:::info
To avoid issues, make sure to set the `maxmemory-policy` value of the redis server config to `allkeys-lfu`, and to set the `maxmemory` value to a reasonable value like `4000mb` for 4gb.

If you do not have your own database then you can create one at [redis.com (Recommended)](https://redis.com/) or [Upstash (Not recommended, pay-as-you-go plan is required)](https://upstash.com/).
