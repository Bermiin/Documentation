### Information

MySQL is recommended for Apollo.

You must create the database before you run Apollo, 
Pterodactyl and other tools automatically do this.

### Hosting

Most Server Hosts include a MySQL database, and it is also [very easy to install, but does require some firewall config to work with Pterodactyl](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mariadb-on-ubuntu-22-04) and can run on [a very cheap vps](https://contabo.com/en/vps/).

If you need a free MySQL database, then [Aiven.io](https://aiven.io/) has a free plan for MySQL on DigitalOcean in some locations. 
PlanetScale also has a free plan but it won't work as expected and will require a dev branch and is therefore not really worth it. 

:::warning
None of these services have been certified to work as expected or work with Apollo, 
as me and all my testers just use our own MySQL/MariaDB databases.
