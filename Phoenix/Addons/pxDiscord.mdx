## Introduction

pxDiscord is a powerful addon for Phoenix that enables players to link their Minecraft account with their Discord account. This addon provides a variety of exciting perks and features that improve the player experience. Users can sync their Discord roles with their Minecraft roles, which makes it easier for server staff to identify players and grant them access to specific permissions. In addition, players can view and participate in staff chat, get notified about server events and announcements, and much more. pxDiscord is a great way to increase player engagement and foster a strong community on your Minecraft server.
