1. Download and install pxVelocity/pxBungee, which can be found on our Discord, into your proxy's plugin folder.
2. Start your proxy and wait until it finishes booting up, once finished, shutdown your proxy.
3. Open global.yml in the newly created Phoenix plugin folder and enter your database details.
4. Start up your proxy again. If the database details are correct, Phoenix will load right up.
