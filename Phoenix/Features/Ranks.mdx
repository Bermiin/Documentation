Ranks allow you to differentiate your players with prefixes, colors, permissions and more.

Each rank has a scope which determines which servers they will apply on. The scope can be `global`, which means the rank will apply on all servers.

Ranks can be invisible which means only the permissions apply to the player.

## Permissions

Permissions define what the player can and cant do. They change how players interact with the server and it's plugins.

Same as above, permissions are also scoped, meaning they only work on specific servers.

### Permission Nodes

An example of a permission node is `core.command.ban` which allows the use of the /ban command.
A complete list of permissions can be found on the [permissions page](/Phoenix/Permissions).

:::tip Did you know?
A permission node can be prepended with a `-` to negate the permission.

For example, `-core.command.list` will disallow the default allowed use of `/list`
:::

### Inheritence

You can set a rank up so that it inherits permissions from other ranks.
If your rank inherits permissions from another, you will get the permissions from the inherited rank.

You can have multiple layers of inheritance, as long as `server.passthrough-children` is enabled in `global.yml`.

## Rank Editor

The rank editor menu allows you to edit the ranks using an in game gui.

Permission: `core.command.rank`

:::danger
Aside from the permission, this requires the player to be a [security user](/Phoenix/Features/Security).
Only give this to people that you trust as it is very dangerous in the wrong hands.
