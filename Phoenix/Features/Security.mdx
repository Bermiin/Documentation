## Prevention

If configured in `global.yml`, users who are granted specific ranks or become opped and aren't a security user,
will be permanently blacklisted. The player as well as the sender can both be configured to be blacklisted in the config.

This is to stop unauthorized access to permissions, and require a manual unblacklist for the player to join again.

## Admin User

If you're a security admin user, you can add other players as security users.
It is recommended that you minimise the amount of players that have this.

:::info
`/security` can only be run by security admin users or from console.
